# Privacy Policy for `blob`

`blob` does not collect, store, or share any personal information unless you explicitly choose to send it to us.

We do not use third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising networks. Any data created or stored by the app remains solely on your device and is not transmitted to us unless you initiate sending it.

## Optional Crash or Failure Reports

If you choose to send a crash report, failure log, or other feedback through the app or by contacting us directly, the information you provide — including any text you enter and any files or logs you attach — will be used solely to diagnose and fix the reported issue.

We do not combine these reports with any other personal information, and we do not share them with third parties.

Submission of such reports is entirely optional, and all fields are optional unless otherwise noted.

## Apple-Provided Crash Logs

Anonymous crash logs may be collected by Apple and shared with us for the sole purpose of identifying and fixing issues. These logs do not contain personally identifiable information.
